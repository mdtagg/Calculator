# Calculator

This project is intended to show understanding of core html css and javascript fundamentals. 

The styling is inspired by the standard iphone calculator app. And is not intended any purpose other than displaying skills practicing code. 

Issues/fixes: When doing different kinds of operations within one calculation the calculate function only takes in the last operator button pressed and executes it on all the numbers in the array. 

Try adding logic to operator buttons such that if calcValue.length is = to 2 then run the calculate function.
